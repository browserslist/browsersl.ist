## Development

To run a local copy for development:

1. Install correct versions of `Node.js` and `pnpm`. There are two ways:
	1. With `asdf` version manager:
		1. Install [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) and asdf plugins for `Node.js` and `pnpm`
		2. Run `asdf install`
	2. Manually (check needed versions in `.tool-versions`)

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run local server:

   ```sh
   pnpm start
   ```

We recommend to install Prettier and EditorConfig plugins to your text editor.
