> A website that shows what browsers supported by a browserslist string

This website uses [browserslist][] and [caniuse][] to display the compatible browsers for a [browserslist search query](https://github.com/ai/browserslist#queries).

## Development

This website runs on [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/). To run locally, after `npm install` to install the dependencies, `npm start` to run the server.

## Contributing

I'm open to any pull requests or bug reports. Anything that has to do with the data that is presented should be opened with [browserslist][] or [caniuse][].
